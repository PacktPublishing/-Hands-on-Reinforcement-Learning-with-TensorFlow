# Hands-on Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-on Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-reinforcement-learning-tensorflow-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788995368), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
You’ve probably heard of Deepmind’s AI playing games and getting really good at playing them (like AlphaGo beating the Go world champion). Such agents are built with the help of a paradigm of machine learning called “Reinforcement Learning” (RL).

In this course, you’ll walk through different approaches to RL. You’ll move from a simple Q-learning to a more complex, deep RL architecture and implement your algorithms using Tensorflow’s Python API. You’ll be training your agents on two different games in a number of complex scenarios to make them more intelligent and perceptive.
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to implement RL-based solutions in your projects from scratch using Tensorflow and Python.
